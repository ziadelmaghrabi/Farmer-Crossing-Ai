 # Farmer-Crossing-AI 🚣‍♂️

AI implementation of the classic **Farmer–Wolf–Goat–Cabbage** river crossing problem.

This project demonstrates **state space representation** and **search algorithms**
by solving the puzzle using **BFS, DFS, and A\*** with a simple Python GUI.

## 🎯 Problem Overview
The goal is to safely move the farmer, wolf, goat, and cabbage from the left bank
to the right bank using a boat that carries the farmer and only one item at a time,
without violating any constraints.

## 🚀 Features
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- A* Search Algorithm
- GUI using Python Tkinter
- Safe state validation and animation

## 🧠 AI Concepts Covered
- State Space Representation
- Search Strategies
- Backtracking
- Performance & Optimality comparison

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Tkinter

## ▶️ How to Run
```bash
python main.py
